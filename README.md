sklearn-compatible Random Rotation Ensembles
===============

Scikit-learn compatible implementations of the Random Rotation Ensemble idea of [Blaser & Fryzlewicz, 2016, JMLR](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/blaser16a/blaser16a.pdf). 

The authors show that random rotations of the feature space in the individual classifiers within the ensemble significantly improves ensemble diversity, and thus overall ensemble accuracy; especially for tree-based ensembles.

Two such tree-based models are implemented here, Random Forests and Extremely Randomized Tree classifiers, and compared below to scikit's standard implementations.

The comparison suite may itself be useful for prototyping and testing new machine learning models (see usage below).
